# [Colour Science Precis for the CGI Artist](https://colour-science.github.io/colour-science-precis/)

The **Colour Science Precis** is a set of posters designed for the computer-generated imagery artist.

Its purpose is to provide essential understanding and terminology for practical application of colour science in the media and entertainment industry.
The **Precis** takes its roots in **Cinematic Color 2**, the unreleased sequel to [Cinematic Color](https://cinematiccolor.org) by Jeremy Selan. Capturing the entirety of Cinematic Color 2 in a few images is impossible, we thus cherry-picked the material we thought was important to be readily available. 

Colour science is a constant evolving field of research: We do not yet have a full understanding on how vision works, thus this **Precis** is merely a snapshot of useful knowledge and will be updated in the future.
